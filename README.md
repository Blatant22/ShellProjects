# Introduction to Extra

Thank you for your interest. Despite the non-descript name of this repository, it's actually full of a _lot_ of presentable, carefully-written shell programs.

Some of the programs within this repository were written and are maintained for a Bourne POSIX-compliant shell (with [Yash](https://yash.osdn.jp/) as guidance), and others are written for the Bourne Again Shell.

As of 2021-01-26, here are some highlights:

  * [autoexec](source/autoexec) - Development tool for automatic execution of files
  * [backmeup](source/backmeup) - Simple and portable solution to HOME backup
  * [cito](source/cito) - Portable installer for local or GitHub files
  * [fetcher](source/fetcher) - Simple interactive multi-file downloader for the terminal.
  * [glkfu](source/glkfu) - Easily compile & build Debian packages for Linux kernels
  * [libtflbp-sh](source/libtflbp-sh) - Function library for Bourne Shell programs.
  * [lspkg](source/lspkg) - Search through, test for, and list out installed packages
  * [rmne](source/rmne) - Remove all of the non-essential Debian packages
  * [simplify-ubuntu](source/simplify-ubuntu) - De-bloat Ubuntu by interactively removing unneeded packages.

# Bug/Issue Reporting

If you have any issues or bugs, I strongly recommend reporting it here on GitHub, as it will surely get my attention. Failing that, since we're not all obsessed with GitHub, send me an E-Mail over at _terminalforlife@yahoo.com_ (rarely checked, if I'm honest). Lastly, I'm _Terminalforlife_ (formerly _Learn Linux_) over at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Terminalforlife), so feel free to leave a comment over there; I always try to read them _all_.

Be sure to provide as much information as possible, if you're reporting a bug, such as program output, error messages, system information, etc.

Thanks!
