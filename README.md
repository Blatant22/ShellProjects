# miscellaneous
Here you'll find my smaller projects, quick scripts, and some configuration files.

## CONTENTS

Some of these files are just quick and dirty scripts, but some are more fleshed out and program-like, so I have provided some installit installers for them. The instructions for those are as usual. Just substitute NAME for the name of the file/program you wish to install.

You'll find here my .vimrc file which I've enjoyed adding to. I'm not that great at vimscript, but I enjoy it and have written some useful plugins I now couldn't live without. I'll get better as time goes by, I'm sure, but I do tend to focus most of my attention on shell, leaving the rest on Linux in general.

I can't seem to stray far from my vim syntax highlighting color scheme. I was inspired by 256_noir. It's just so damn nice to look at, and helps me spot silly things like a forgotten brace, quote, or grave; I've included it too, if you're interested in checking that out; it's the tfl.vim file.

## INSTALLATION
