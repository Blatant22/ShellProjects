# Portable and efficient solution for determining whether a user has 'root'
# access via sudo(8) and the 'sudo' or 'wheel' groups. This of course depends
# on the '/etc/group' file and it being readable. I wrote this for a user on
# Discord.
#
# While you can also run `sudo -l` or `sudo -v`, you'll often still be asked
# for a password. You can't use `su` to gain 'root' access to check 'sudoers'
# either, because not all systems allow 'root' access in that way, such as
# Ubuntu-based systems which lock the 'root' account via su(1). This script
# just relies on groups, but it's a nice enough solution, I believe.
