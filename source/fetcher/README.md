### Description

Add to or remove from a simple list of remote files which you can then download in bulk, with Fetcher. The actual downloading is handled by Wget.

NOTE: This is a work-in-progress -- consider it beta.

### Requirements

Written for Linux.

Depends:

* BASH (>= 4.3)
* coreutils
* sed
* Wget

### Files

The installer provides the following:

* '/usr/local/bin/fetcher'
* '/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/fetcher'
* '/usr/share/man/man1/fetcher.1.gz'

### Contributions

The best way to help is to let me know of any bugs or oversights.

If you wish to contribute any code, try to keep to the existing programming style. Avoid reaching outside of the language whenever possible or reasonable, and keep things consistent and presentable. If you're contributing a new file, such as a helper or wrapper, try to stick to similar dependencies (where reasonable) and please keep the style of the output the same.

If submitting any documentation, try to ensure the English is correct and presentable.
