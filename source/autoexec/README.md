# AutoExec - Development tool for automatic execution of scripts

Together with an editor like Vi-IMproved, EMACS, or even Nano, this development tool allows the user the pleasure of programming in an IDE-like environment, surrounded by terminals. Simply touching (writing to) the file will result in the re-execution of it.

Flexibly, the user can make use of AutoExec when working with Perl, Python, Shell, AWK, and Ruby; this is, however, not a complete list, as it's very likely AutoExec can be used in multiple additional ways.

The user can either rely on AutoExec's own interpreter auto-detection, or override with his or her own choice of executable.

# Installation & Uninstallation

AutoExec is installable with [cito(8)](https://github.com/terminalforlife/Extra/tree/master/source/cito), Debian packages found in the DEB-Packages repository, or, if you're on Arch Linux, can be installed using the AUR, thanks to Minhaj.

# Bugs

Bugs will be handled as soon as possible, but you can speed things up by reporting them. I cannot fix what I don't know exists! Please refer to the **AutoExec** man page (`man autoexec`) and refer to the **BUGS** section.
