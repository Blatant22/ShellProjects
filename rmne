# This is a work in progress, and a very dangerous one at that! Do NOT run this
# willy-nilly, lest you fry your Linux installation. The purpose of this small
# program is to remove all of the non-essential packages, for educational, fun, or
# other purposes, such as setting up a specific type of installation.
#
# This program is ONLY for Debian and Ubuntu, or distributions based thereon.
